# blockchainnd-supplychain-part-b
Project for Part B of Term 2 Blockchain Udacity Nanodeegre Supply Chain project

For more information about Udacity BLockchain Developer Nanodegree check the [site](https://www.udacity.com/course/blockchain-developer-nanodegree--nd1309).
Some code from [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd1309-Project-6b-Example-Template) was imported to the contract.

**Describe a Supply Chain using Blockchain for the process of writing and selling a book. Since the abract and book approval to proced until the delivery to libraries.**

Resources:
1. **UML Diagrams** (`diagram` folder)
1. **Smart Contract** (`contracts` folder)
1. **Front-End in Node** (`webclient` folder)

#UML Diagrams

*Contain the following Diagrams that describes the Smart Contract:*

1. Book Writing - Activity Diagram
1. Book Writing - Sequence Diagram

#Smart Contract
A Smart Contract was developed using [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.6/) and the [Ethereum Blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org/)

To develop this Smart Contract was used:
1. Truffle Ganache to create a local blockchain. 
   1. Some issues forced the use of JavaScript VM Env for payable method, see more [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli/issues/497)
   1. mnemonic:
      1. scale suit normal possible arm boost ridge blame orphan pilot rigid quit
1. Remix IDE to code solidity (.sol) files
   1. To compile and SYNC with local files the remixd npm module was used, see more details [here](https://remix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_remixd_filesystem.html):
      1. `remixd -s <absolute-path-to-the-shared-folder> --remix-ide https://remix.ethereum.org`
   
For dev mode Ganache was used with one account per Role, when deployed in Rinkeby network only one account was used to reproduce the Roles.
### Smart Contract Rinkeby address:
>PENDING ADDRESS

### Account
>PENDING ADDRESS

### Tx
>PENDING ADDRESS

## Smart Contract files
1. Folder `accesscontrol` contains the contracts with logic for the Roles:
1. Folder `base` contains the supply chain contract and the Transactions recorded:
    1. `SupplyChain.sol` supply chain with the method to interect with the Supply Chain
    1. `book1_scenario.json` file with the Transactions recorded in the Remix IDE Runtime, see how to use it [here](https://remix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_tab.html).
    Use this file to reproduce the scenario tested.
1. Folder `coew` contains the contract to ownership and transfer functions.
